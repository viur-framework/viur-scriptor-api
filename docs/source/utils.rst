extract_items and map_extract_items
-----------------------------------
A task scriptor is often used for is the extraction of data (most commonly into a table). ``extract_items`` and
``map_extract_items`` are aimed to ease the extraction of datapoints. They don't cover every use-case, but the most
common ones, and thus spare the developers of new scripts most of the repetitive work.
Since examples working with the database would need to be highly specific to the customers data, we'll use fictional
demo-data.

This example shows how to extract the first names of a user and the first names of all of their friends.
The demo-data contains two users, which are iterated over inside ``map_extract_items``. The mapping defines, what data
will be extracted from the given data and which name it will get in the result. The extraction of the first name of
the user is simple: As you
would select the first_name from a dictionary with ``dictionary["first_name"]``, you have to add ``"first_name"`` to the
extrator-list. Similarly, you'd select the friends of a user with ``dictionary["friends"]``, which would be a list you'd
need to iterate over. To signal to the extractor, that you want to iterate it, you can write three dots (``...``) called
``Ellipsis`` in Python. The following selectors then get applied to each element of the list. The result of this is then
printed. Afterwards a table-file is made from the data, which is then converted to a list of lists representing
the tables data, which is then shown in a ``Dialog.table``.

The ``join_with``-parameter defines how list-elements are concatenated. Setting it implies that all results are
converted to ``string``. Try removing it from the example code. You'll see, that the friends names aren't in a single
``string`` anymore, but in a list. This will also lead to the ``Dialog.table`` raising an error. This is useful if you
want to modify the data before saving or displaying it.

    #### scriptor ####
    from viur.scriptor import *

    async def main():
        demo_data = [
            {
                "first_name": "Peter",
                "last_name": "Jones",
                "friends": [
                    {"first_name": "Darrell", "last_name": "Bryant"},
                    {"first_name": "Julie", "last_name": "Brooks"},
                    {"first_name": "Erin", "last_name": "Jimenez"}
                ]
            },
            {
                "first_name": "Amy",
                "last_name": "Stephenson",
                "friends": [
                    {"first_name": "Christina", "last_name": "Allen"},
                    {"first_name": "Joel", "last_name": "Alvarez"},
                    {"first_name": "Melanie", "last_name": "Rivera"},
                    {"first_name": "Erica", "last_name": "Nicholson"},
                    {"first_name": "Roy", "last_name": "Weaver"}
                ]
            }
        ]
        mapping = {
            "First Name": ["first_name"],
            "Friends first Names": ["friends", ..., "first_name"]
        }
        extracted_data = map_extract_items(demo_data, mapping, join_with=", ")
        table_file = File.from_table(extracted_data)
        list_table_header, *list_table_data = table_file.as_list_table()
        await Dialog.table(list_table_header, list_table_data)


Note that ``map_extract_items`` recognises if you pass a list or a dict. If you pass a list, it will automatically
assume the mapping applies to the items of the list and iterate over it.

That means that
``extracted_data = map_extract_items(demo_data, mapping, join_with=", ")`` does the same as

.. code-block:: python

    extracted_data = []
    for user in demo_data:
        extracted_data.append(map_extract_items(user, mapping, join_with=", "))


If you want to extract more complex data, or want to transform the data, you need to iterate over the result of
``map_extract_items``. In this example, we'll so the same as before, but also extract the last names of the friends.
Note that we removed the ``join_with``-parameter, because we need the names as a list.
